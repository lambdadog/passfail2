#+TITLE: Pass/Fail 2

An addon for Anki that removes the wide spectrum of "Again", "Easy",
"Good", "Hard" buttons from your Anki reviews, instead choosing to
offer you only two options: "Fail" and "Pass", setting keybinds to
Fail:1, Pass:2/3/4.

The goal of this addon is twofold:

 1. The wide spectrum of buttons introduces decision paralysis when
    reviewing. This is undesirable as when reviewing you should be
    thinking more about what you're reviewing than what button to
    press.
 2. The "Hard" button in Anki has an effect the opposite of what you
    would desire -- when you find something difficult, it increases
    the amount of time before you review it again, giving you more
    time to forget it. Pass/Fail 2 counters this design by simply
    removing the Hard button in the first place.

As of version v0.3.0, this add-on now supports custom colors and text on your buttons!
Just go to add-ons > pass / fail 2 > config and modify the buttons as you please.
Then, close and re-open Anki, and your changes should be reflected!
